# HackyTractor

These are files to do with my little electric vehicle. It's a Hacky Racer, as a tractor, with the purpose of moving stuff rather than going fast.

## Pulley files
A V-belt pulley for a Renault alternator converted to be a motor.
This requires the OpenSCAD pulley library from [machineree], at https://github.com/machineree/OpenSCAD_Pulley_Library
